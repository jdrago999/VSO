DESCRIPTION
    VSO aims to offer a declarative OO style for Perl with very little
    overhead, without being overly-minimalist.

    VSO is a simplified Perl5 object type system *similar* to Moose, but
    simpler.

  TYPES
    VSO offers the following type system:

      Any
        Item
            Bool
            Undef
            Defined
                Value
                    Str
                        Num
                            Int
                        ClassName
                Ref
                    ScalarRef
                    ArrayRef
                    HashRef
                    CodeRef
                    RegexpRef
                    GlobRef
                        FileHandle
                    Object

    Missing from the Moose type system are:

    Maybe[`a]
        If it's a 'Maybe[whatever]', just do "required => 0"

    RoleName
        VSO does not currently support 'roles'.
